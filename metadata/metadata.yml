name: Final_Interpretable Deep Learning to Detect Alzheimer's Disease
description: |-
  Alzheimer’s disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Alzheimer’s is typically diagnosed
  through expensive imaging methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scan and magnetic res-
  onance imaging (MRI), as well as invasive methods, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis. In this study, we
  develop an interpretable hierarchical deep learning model to detect the presence of Alzheimer’s disease from
  interview transcripts of individuals who were asked to describe a picture. Our deep recurrent neural net-
  work employs a novel attention over self-attention (AoS) mechanism to model the temporal dependencies
  of longitudinal data. We demonstrate the interpretability of the model with the importance score of words,
  sentences, and transcripts extracted from our three-level hierarchical AoS model. Numerical results demon-
  strate that our deep learning model can detect Alzheimer’s disease from the transcript of patient interviews
  with 98% accuracy when tested on the DementiaBank dataset. Our interpretable neural network model can
  help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in a non-invasive and affordable manner, improve patient outcomes, and
  result in cost containment.
